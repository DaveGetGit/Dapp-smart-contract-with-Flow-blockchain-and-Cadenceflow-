# Steps to make this work:

Make sure you have the latest version of FCL: https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install/

Next, make sure to `npm install`.

Then, open 4 terminals (lol)

1. In the first terminal, run `npm run dev`

2. In the second terminal, run `flow emulator start -v`

3. In the third terminal, run `flow dev-wallet`

4. In the fourth terminal, run `flow project deploy`

## Playing around with the front end

1. Log into the front end by clicking "Log in" and then selecting the first account. 
2. Click "Get Greeting". You'll see the greeting appear. 
3. You can change the greeting by typing into the little input and clicking "Change Greeting"
